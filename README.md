# Takes-TwoLists-Returns-BinaryTree
A function in ReasonML that takes two lists and returns a binary tree. 

A function in ReasonML that takes two lists and returns a binary tree. The two lists give respectively the preorder and inorder traversals of the resulting tree. You should assume that the inputs are lists of integers of the same length, with no numbers repeated in a single list.

For example, if the inputs are [2, 1, 3] and [1, 2, 3], then the output should be TreeNode(TreeNode(EmptyTree, 1, EmptyTree), 2, TreeNode(EmptyTree, 3, EmptyTree)).
